wwwTo generate a series of months, create a new DataFrame, and then add it to an existing DataFrame, you can use the pandas library in Python. Here's a step-by-step example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Existing DataFrame (you can replace this with your own DataFrame)
existing_data = pd.DataFrame({'Date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-02-01', '2023-03-01']})

# Generate a series of months
months = pd.date_range(start='2023-04-01', end='2023-12-01', freq='MS')

# Create a new DataFrame for the months
months_df = pd.DataFrame({'Date': months})

# Concatenate the existing DataFrame and the new months DataFrame
combined_data = pd.concat([existing_data, months_df], ignore_index=True)

# Print the combined DataFrame
print(combined_data)
```

In this code, we first create an existing DataFrame called `existing_data`. Then, we generate a series of months from April to December 2023 using the `pd.date_range` function. We create a new DataFrame `months_df` to store these months. Finally, we use `pd.concat` to concatenate the existing data and the new months data into a single DataFrame called `combined_data`.




If you want to create a series of months with names (e.g., "January," "February") and add a separate column for the month names, you can do the following:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Generate a series of months
months = pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2023-12-01', freq='MS')

# Create a new DataFrame with a 'Date' column
months_df = pd.DataFrame({'Date': months})

# Add a new column with month names
months_df['Month'] = months_df['Date'].dt.strftime('%B')

# Print the DataFrame
print(months_df)
```

In this code, we first generate a series of months using `pd.date_range`. Then, we create a new DataFrame with a 'Date' column. To add a separate column for the month names, we use the `dt.strftime('%B')` method to extract the month names from the 'Date' column and store them in a new column named 'Month'.


In the code provided, `freq='MS'` is used as a parameter in the `pd.date_range` function to specify the frequency of the date range. 

- 'M' stands for months.
- 'S' stands for start of the month.

So, when you use `freq='MS'`, it means you want to generate a date range with monthly frequency starting from the beginning of each month. In other words, it will produce a series of dates representing the start of each month. For example, '2023-01-01' represents the start of January 2023, '2023-02-01' represents the start of February 2023, and so on.

ALL ABOUT DATE AND TIME IN PYTHON 

Certainly! Date and time handling in Python is primarily managed using the `datetime` module from the Python Standard Library. This module provides classes and functions to work with dates and times. Here's an overview of some of the key components:

1. **`datetime` Class:**
   - The `datetime` class is the core component of the `datetime` module.
   - It represents a point in time and includes both date and time information.
   - You can create a `datetime` object with various attributes like year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.

   ```python
   from datetime import datetime

   now = datetime.now()  # Get the current date and time
   specific_date = datetime(2023, 10, 26, 15, 30, 0)  # Create a specific date and time
   ```

2. **`date` and `time` Classes:**
   - The `date` class represents date information (year, month, day), and the `time` class represents time information (hour, minute, second, microsecond).
   - These can be used independently or combined into a `datetime` object.

   ```python
   from datetime import date, time

   today = date.today()  # Get the current date
   specific_time = time(15, 30, 0)  # Create a specific time
   ```

3. **Date Formatting and Parsing:**
   - You can format `datetime` objects into strings and parse strings into `datetime` objects using the `strftime` and `strptime` methods.

   ```python
   formatted_date = now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')  # Format to a string
   parsed_date = datetime.strptime('2023-10-26 15:30:00', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')  # Parse from a string
   ```

4. **Timedelta:**
   - The `timedelta` class represents a duration or time difference between two `datetime` objects.

   ```python
   from datetime import timedelta

   delta = timedelta(days=5, hours=3, minutes=30)
   new_date = now + delta  # Adding a timedelta to a datetime
   ```

5. **Time Zones:**
   - Python's `datetime` module provides limited support for working with time zones using the `pytz` library.
   - You can use `pytz` to work with time zones and localize `datetime` objects.

6. **Calendar and Date Arithmetic:**
   - The `calendar` module can help you work with calendars and perform date arithmetic.
   - You can calculate differences between dates, find days of the week, and more.

   ```python
   import calendar

   day_of_week = calendar.day_name[specific_date.weekday()]  # Get the day of the week
   ```

These are the fundamental concepts for working with dates and times in Python. The `datetime` module is quite flexible and powerful, allowing you to handle a wide range of date and time-related tasks.



UTC TO IST TIME CHANGE
To convert a datetime from UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) to IST (Indian Standard Time) in Python, you can use the `pytz` library, which provides support for working with time zones. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, make sure you have the `pytz` library installed. If it's not installed, you can install it using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install pytz
   ```

2. Here's an example of how to convert a UTC datetime to IST:

   ```python
   from datetime import datetime
   import pytz

   # Create a UTC datetime
   utc_time = datetime(2023, 10, 26, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.UTC)

   # Convert to IST
   ist = pytz.timezone('Asia/Kolkata')
   ist_time = utc_time.astimezone(ist)

   print(f'UTC Time: {utc_time}')
   print(f'IST Time: {ist_time}')
   ```

   In this example, we create a UTC datetime and then use the `astimezone` method to convert it to the IST time zone. We specify the 'Asia/Kolkata' time zone, which corresponds to IST.

Make sure to replace the UTC time and time zone with your specific date and time values if needed. Also, note that you can change the time zone to match the specific region you're interested in.




Certainly! The `timedelta` class in Python is used to represent a duration or time difference between two `datetime` objects. It's a versatile and useful class for performing date and time arithmetic. Let's explore `timedelta` with several examples:

**1. Creating a `timedelta` object:**
   - You can create a `timedelta` object by specifying the duration in terms of days, seconds, microseconds, milliseconds, minutes, hours, or weeks.

   ```python
   from datetime import timedelta

   # Create a timedelta representing 5 days
   five_days = timedelta(days=5)

   # Create a timedelta representing 2 hours and 30 minutes
   two_hours_thirty_minutes = timedelta(hours=2, minutes=30)
   ```

**2. Basic Arithmetic Operations:**
   - You can perform basic arithmetic operations with `timedelta` objects, such as addition and subtraction.

   ```python
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Calculate a date in the future
   now = datetime.now()
   future_date = now + timedelta(days=7)

   # Calculate a date in the past
   past_date = now - timedelta(hours=12)
   ```

**3. Finding the Difference Between Two Dates:**
   - You can calculate the time difference between two `datetime` objects using a `timedelta`.

   ```python
   from datetime import datetime

   # Calculate the time between two dates
   date1 = datetime(2023, 10, 26, 12, 0, 0)
   date2 = datetime(2023, 10, 27, 14, 30, 0)
   time_difference = date2 - date1
   ```

**4. Combining `timedelta` with `datetime`:**
   - You can use a `timedelta` to add or subtract a duration to/from a `datetime` object.

   ```python
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Add 3 hours to the current time
   now = datetime.now()
   three_hours_later = now + timedelta(hours=3)

   # Subtract 30 minutes from a specific time
   specific_time = datetime(2023, 10, 26, 15, 0, 0)
   earlier_time = specific_time - timedelta(minutes=30)
   ```

**5. Formatting `timedelta` for Readability:**
   - You can format a `timedelta` object to display it in a human-readable format.

   ```python
   from datetime import timedelta

   # Create a timedelta
   duration = timedelta(days=2, hours=6, minutes=30)

   # Format the timedelta
   formatted_duration = str(duration)
   ```

These examples should help you understand how to work with `timedelta` objects in Python. They are particularly useful for tasks that involve time differences, scheduling, or date arithmetic.



You can convert time from Eastern Standard Time (EST) to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in Python using the `pytz` library. First, you'll need to install the `pytz` library if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:

```python
pip install pytz
```

Then, you can use the following code to perform the conversion:

```python
import datetime
import pytz

# Define the time in EST
est = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')
est_time = datetime.datetime.now(est)

# Convert EST time to UTC
utc_time = est_time.astimezone(pytz.utc)

print("EST Time:", est_time)
print("UTC Time:", utc_time)
```

This code first creates a `datetime` object representing the current time in EST, and then it converts it to UTC using the `astimezone` method. Make sure to replace 'US/Eastern' with the appropriate timezone if you are working with a different EST time zone.

EST TO UTC 
You can use the `pytz` library along with pandas to convert date columns in a DataFrame from Eastern Standard Time (EST) to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Here's a sample code to demonstrate how to do this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pytz

# Sample DataFrame with date columns in EST
data = {'Date1': ['2023-10-26 09:00:00', '2023-10-26 10:30:00'],
        'Date2': ['2023-10-26 08:45:00', '2023-10-26 11:15:00'],
        'Date3': ['2023-10-26 07:30:00', '2023-10-26 12:45:00']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define the EST timezone
est = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')

# Convert date columns to UTC
for column in ['Date1', 'Date2', 'Date3']:
    df[column] = pd.to_datetime(df[column]).dt.tz_localize(est).dt.tz_convert('UTC')

print(df)
```

This code first defines a sample DataFrame with three date columns. It then uses the `pd.to_datetime` method to convert the date columns to datetime objects and applies the EST timezone using `tz_localize`. Finally, it converts these columns to UTC using `tz_convert('UTC')`. The result is a DataFrame with date columns converted to UTC. Adjust the column names and DataFrame to match your specific data.


If you want to see the comparison between the original EST date columns and the converted UTC date columns in your DataFrame, you can add additional columns to the DataFrame for this purpose. Here's an extended example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pytz

# Sample DataFrame with date columns in EST
data = {'Date1': ['2023-10-26 09:00:00', '2023-10-26 10:30:00'],
        'Date2': ['2023-10-26 08:45:00', '2023-10-26 11:15:00'],
        'Date3': ['2023-10-26 07:30:00', '2023-10-26 12:45:00']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define the EST timezone
est = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')

# Convert date columns to UTC
for column in ['Date1', 'Date2', 'Date3']:
    df[column] = pd.to_datetime(df[column]).dt.tz_localize(est).dt.tz_convert('UTC')

# Add columns for comparison
for column in ['Date1', 'Date2', 'Date3']:
    original_column = column + '_EST'
    df[original_column] = pd.to_datetime(data[column])

# Print the DataFrame to see the comparison
print(df)
```

This code not only converts the date columns to UTC but also adds new columns with the original EST date values. You can compare the original EST dates with the converted UTC dates by examining the DataFrame. Adjust the column names and DataFrame to match your specific data.



If you have a DataFrame with timestamp columns and you want to filter it based on a specific date, you can use the `pd.to_datetime` method along with the `.dt` accessor in pandas. Here's how to do it:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame with timestamp column
data = {'TimestampColumn': ['2023-10-26 09:00:00', '2023-10-27 10:30:00', '2023-10-28 11:45:00', '2023-10-29 14:15:00'],
        'Value': [10, 15, 20, 25]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert 'TimestampColumn' to datetime objects
df['TimestampColumn'] = pd.to_datetime(df['TimestampColumn'])

# Define the date for filtering
desired_date = '2023-10-28'

# Filter rows where the date matches the desired date
filtered_df = df[df['TimestampColumn'].dt.date == pd.to_datetime(desired_date).date()]

print(filtered_df)
```

In this example, we first convert the 'TimestampColumn' to datetime objects using `pd.to_datetime`. Then, we define the `desired_date` in the same format as the dates in the DataFrame. Finally, we use the `.dt.date` accessor to extract the date portion from the timestamp column and compare it with the desired date to filter the DataFrame.

You can adjust the `desired_date` and the column names according to your specific data.



To send an email using a specific email account in Outlook using the `win32com` library in Python, you can use the following code. This code allows you to specify the email account to send from:

```python
import win32com.client

# Create an Outlook application object
outlook = win32com.client.Dispatch("Outlook.Application")

# Get the accounts in Outlook
namespace = outlook.GetNamespace("MAPI")
accounts = namespace.Accounts

# Define the index of the email account you want to use (0 for the first account, 1 for the second, etc.)
account_index = 1  # Change this to the index of your second email account

# Create a new email item
mail = outlook.CreateItem(0)

# Set the sender account
mail._oleobj_.Invoke(*(64209, 0, 8, 0, accounts[account_index]))

# Compose the email
mail.Subject = "Your Subject"
mail.Body = "Your Email Body"
mail.To = "recipient@example.com"

# Send the email
mail.Send()

# Release the Outlook application
del outlook
```

In this code:

1. We use `win32com.client.Dispatch("Outlook.Application")` to create an Outlook application object.

2. We access the email accounts in Outlook using `namespace.Accounts`.

3. You need to specify the `account_index` to select the second email account. The index is zero-based, so 0 corresponds to the first account, 1 to the second account, and so on.

4. We create a new email item using `outlook.CreateItem(0)`.

5. We set the sender account using `mail._oleobj_.Invoke(*(64209, 0, 8, 0, accounts[account_index]))`.

6. Set the email's subject, body, and recipient.

7. Finally, send the email using `mail.Send()`.

Make sure you have the `pywin32` library installed, and adjust the email details and account index to match your requirements.

Certainly! If you want the column names to be in the format 'August 2, 2023', 'August 3, 2023', and so on, you can use the following Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import datetime

# Your existing DataFrame
# Replace this with your actual DataFrame
existing_df = pd.DataFrame({'column1': [1, 2, 3], 'column2': ['a', 'b', 'c']})

# Define the start and end dates for your continuous months
start_date = datetime.date(2023, 8, 2)
end_date = datetime.date(2026, 10, 31)

# Generate the list of continuous months
date_list = [start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=x) for x in range((end_date - start_date).days + 1)]

# Convert the dates to your desired format (e.g., 'August 2, 2023')
formatted_dates = [date.strftime('%B %d, %Y') for date in date_list]

# Add columns to the existing DataFrame with the generated dates
for date in formatted_dates:
    existing_df[date] = None  # You can replace 'None' with your desired default value

# Display the updated DataFrame
print(existing_df)
```

This code generates a list of continuous dates and adds columns to your existing DataFrame with these dates in the specified format. Replace `existing_df` with your actual DataFrame, and you can customize the start and end dates accordingly.


Certainly! If you want to calculate the cumulative sum for each column separately, while keeping non-numeric columns in the modified DataFrame, you can do the following:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = {'Column1': [1, 2, 3],
        'Column2': [4, 5, 6],
        'Column3': [7, 8, 9],
        'Column4': [10, 11, 12],
        'Column5': [13, 14, 15],
        'TextColumn': ['A', 'B', 'C']}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Identify numeric and non-numeric columns
numeric_columns = df.select_dtypes(include='number').columns
non_numeric_columns = df.select_dtypes(exclude='number').columns

# Calculate cumulative sum for each numeric column
cumulative_sum_df = df[numeric_columns].cumsum(axis=0)

# Combine the cumulative sum DataFrame with non-numeric columns
modified_df = pd.concat([df[non_numeric_columns], cumulative_sum_df], axis=1)

# Display the modified DataFrame
print(modified_df)
```

This code calculates the cumulative sum for each numeric column separately along the columns (axis=0) and then combines the result with non-numeric columns in the `modified_df`.

Replace `df` with your actual DataFrame. After running this code, `modified_df` will contain the cumulative sum for each numeric column while preserving the non-numeric columns.


Certainly! You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write an Excel file and set the column widths to autofit. Make sure to install the library first using `pip install openpyxl`. Here's a simple example:

```python
import openpyxl

# Create a new workbook and select the active sheet
workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()
sheet = workbook.active

# Example data to be written to the Excel file
data = [
    ["Name", "Age", "City"],
    ["John Doe", 25, "New York"],
    ["Jane Smith", 30, "San Francisco"],
    ["Bob Johnson", 28, "Chicago"],
]

# Write data to the sheet
for row in data:
    sheet.append(row)

# Autofit columns
for column in sheet.columns:
    max_length = 0
    column = [cell for cell in column]
    for cell in column:
        try:
            if len(str(cell.value)) > max_length:
                max_length = len(cell.value)
        except:
            pass
    adjusted_width = (max_length + 2)
    sheet.column_dimensions[column[0].column_letter].width = adjusted_width

# Save the workbook
workbook.save("output.xlsx")
```

This code creates a new Excel workbook, writes some sample data to it, and then autofits the column widths before saving the workbook as "output.xlsx". Adjust the data and file name as needed for your specific use case.



Certainly! You can use the `openpyxl` library to open an existing Excel file, and then autofit the column widths. Here's an example:

```python
import openpyxl

# Load the existing workbook
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook('your_existing_file.xlsx')

# Select the active sheet (you can change the sheet name accordingly)
sheet = workbook.active

# Autofit columns
for column in sheet.columns:
    max_length = 0
    column = [cell for cell in column]
    for cell in column:
        try:
            if len(str(cell.value)) > max_length:
                max_length = len(cell.value)
        except:
            pass
    adjusted_width = (max_length + 2)
    sheet.column_dimensions[column[0].column_letter].width = adjusted_width

# Save the workbook (use a different filename to avoid overwriting the original)
workbook.save('your_autofitted_file.xlsx')
```

Make sure to replace 'your_existing_file.xlsx' with the actual name of your Excel file. The code will load the existing workbook, autofit the column widths, and save the modified workbook with a different name ('your_autofitted_file.xlsx').


Yes, you can autofit columns without explicitly using `openpyxl` by relying on the features provided by the `pandas` library itself. Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame (replace this with your actual DataFrame)
data = {
    'Name': ['John Doe', 'Jane Smith', 'Bob Johnson'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 28],
    'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Chicago']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Write the DataFrame to an Excel file and get the ExcelWriter object
with pd.ExcelWriter('output.xlsx', engine='xlsxwriter') as writer:
    df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Sheet1', index=False)

    # Get the xlsxwriter workbook and worksheet objects
    workbook  = writer.book
    worksheet = writer.sheets['Sheet1']

    # Iterate through all columns and set the width to the maximum length of the column data
    for i, col in enumerate(df.columns):
        max_length = max(df[col].astype(str).apply(len).max(), len(col))
        worksheet.set_column(i, i, max_length + 2)

# The Excel file is saved with autofitted columns
```

In this example, we use the `xlsxwriter` engine provided by `pandas.ExcelWriter` to create the Excel file. After writing the DataFrame to the Excel file, we get the `workbook` and `worksheet` objects from the ExcelWriter and then iterate through the columns to set the width based on the maximum length of the column data. This approach allows you to autofit columns without explicitly using `




Certainly, I'll modify the code to include the creation of DataFrames for each month with updated names (`df_next_month1`, `df_next_month2`, ..., `df_next_month5`). Please note that you might need to adjust the exact calculations based on your data and requirements:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df95 is your initial DataFrame

# Define the loop for the next 4-5 months
for month in range(1, 6):
    # Create a new DataFrame for the current month
    df_current_month = df95.copy()

    # Perform necessary calculations for the current month
    df_current_month[f'attr_Mar24_{month}'] = df_current_month['Emp_cnt'] * 0.0125 * 8
    # ... Continue with the rest of your calculations for the current month

    # Create df96 for the current month
    df96 = pd.pivot_table(df_current_month, values=f'attr_Mar24_{month}', aggfunc='sum', index=['Associated Market']).reset_index()
    df96.rename(columns={f'attr_Mar24_{month}': f'attr_Mar24_Total_{month}'}, inplace=True)

    # Merge df_current_month with df96
    df_current_month = pd.merge(df_current_month, df96, on='Associated Market', how='inner', indicator=True).drop(columns=['_merge'])

    # Create df98 for the current month
    df98 = pd.pivot_table(df_current_month, values='Remaining_Feb24_1', aggfunc='sum', index=['Associated Market', 'FUNCTION GROUP']).reset_index()
    df98.rename(columns={'Remaining_Feb24_1': f'Emp_fnct_mar24_cnt_{month}'}, inplace=True)

    # Merge df_current_month with df98
    df_current_month = pd.merge(df_current_month, df98, on=['Associated Market', 'FUNCTION GROUP'], how='inner', indicator=True)

    # Create df100 for the current month
    df100 = pd.pivot_table(df_current_month, values='Emp_fnct_mar24_cnt', aggfunc='max', index=['Associated Market']).reset_index()
    df100.rename(columns={'Emp_fnct_mar24_cnt': f'max_Emp_fnct_mar24_cnt_{month}'}, inplace=True)

    # Merge df_current_month with df100
    df_current_month = pd.merge(df_current_month, df100, on='Associated Market', how='left', indicator=True).drop(columns=['_merge'])

    # ... Continue with the rest of your code, applying Jpriority and Remains functions

    # After completing all calculations for the current month, save or use the result DataFrame
    globals()[f'df_next_month{month}'] = df_current_month.copy()
```

This code creates DataFrames for each month (`df_next_month1`, `df_next_month2`, ..., `df_next_month5`) and performs the necessary calculations for each month based on the previous month's details. Adjust the calculations and DataFrame structures as needed for your specific use case.



Certainly! I understand that you want a more dynamic approach with nested loops for the multiplier, month, and DataFrame names. Here's how you can structure the code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df95 is your initial DataFrame
current_df = df95

# Define the loop for the next 4-5 months
for month in range(1, 6):
    # Create a new DataFrame for the current month
    current_df_name = f'df{95 + month}'
    globals()[current_df_name] = current_df.copy()

    # Define the loop for the multiplier range (e.g., 11 to 15)
    for multiplier in range(11, 16):
        # Perform necessary calculations for the current month and multiplier
        attr_col_name = f'attr_Mar24_{month}_{multiplier}'
        globals()[current_df_name][attr_col_name] = current_df['Emp_cnt'] * 0.0125 * multiplier
        # ... Continue with the rest of your calculations for the current month and multiplier

    # Create df96 for the current month
    df96 = pd.pivot_table(globals()[current_df_name], values=f'attr_Mar24_{month}_11', aggfunc='sum', index=['Associated Market']).reset_index()
    df96.rename(columns={f'attr_Mar24_{month}_11': f'attr_Mar24_Total_{month}'}, inplace=True)

    # Merge globals()[current_df_name] with df96
    globals()[current_df_name] = pd.merge(globals()[current_df_name], df96, on='Associated Market', how='inner', indicator=True).drop(columns=['_merge'])

    # ... Continue with the rest of your code, applying Jpriority and Remains functions

    # After completing all calculations for the current month, update current_df for the next iteration
    current_df = globals()[current_df_name].copy()
```

This code introduces three nested loops: one for the month, one for the multiplier, and one for creating dynamic DataFrame names. It performs calculations based on the current month and multiplier, and creates new DataFrames for each iteration with dynamic names. Adjust the ranges and calculations as needed for your specific use case.
