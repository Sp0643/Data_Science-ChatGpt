kiCertainly! You can achieve this by writing a Python code that determines the last working day based on the current day of the week. Here's a sample code to do that:

```python
import datetime

# Get the current date
current_date = datetime.datetime.now()

# Calculate the day of the week (0 = Monday, 1 = Tuesday, ..., 6 = Sunday)
day_of_week = current_date.weekday()

# Define a dictionary to map days of the week to their respective previous working days
working_days = {
    0: 4,  # Monday maps to Friday
    1: 0,  # Tuesday maps to Monday
    2: 1,  # Wednesday maps to Tuesday
    3: 2,  # Thursday maps to Wednesday
    4: 3,  # Friday maps to Thursday
    5: 4,  # Saturday maps to Friday
    6: 4   # Sunday maps to Friday
}

# Get the last working day based on the current day
last_working_day = current_date - datetime.timedelta(days=day_of_week - working_days[day_of_week])

# Print the last working day
print("Last working day is:", last_working_day.strftime("%A"))
```

This code first calculates the current day of the week (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, etc.) and then uses a dictionary to map each day to its corresponding previous working day. Finally, it calculates and prints the last working day based on the current day. can create a Python function to select the last working date (Monday to Friday) by checking the current date and going back in time until a working day is found. Here's a sample function that does this:

```python
import datetime

def last_working_date():
    today = datetime.date.today()
    while today.weekday() > 4:  # Check if it's Saturday or Sunday (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday)
        today -= datetime.timedelta(days=1)  # Go back one day
    return today

# Test the function
last_work_day = last_working_date()
print("Last working date:", last_work_day)
```

This function uses the `datetime` module to get the current date and then subtracts days from it until it finds a weekday (Monday to Friday). It stops when it finds the last working day and returns that date.

Keep in mind that this code assumes a standard working week from Monday to Friday. If your workweek is different, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.




@code 3



I understand your requirement now. You want to find the date of the last Friday regardless of the current day of the week. Here's a Python code that does that:

```python
import datetime

# Get the current date
current_date = datetime.datetime.now()

# Calculate the days to subtract to get to the last Friday (0 = Monday, 1 = Tuesday, ..., 6 = Sunday)
days_to_subtract = (current_date.weekday() - 4) % 7

# Calculate the last Friday's date
last_friday = current_date - datetime.timedelta(days=days_to_subtract)

# Print the date of the last Friday
print("Date of the last Friday:", last_friday.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))
```

This code calculates the number of days to subtract from the current date to reach the last Friday and then calculates the date of the last Friday accordingly.




@code 4


Sure, you can achieve this in Python by using the `datetime` module. Here's a code snippet that will give you the last working day:

```python
import datetime

def find_last_working_day(today):
    while True:
        today -= datetime.timedelta(days=1)
        if today.weekday() < 5:  # Monday to Friday (0 to 4 are weekdays)
            return today

# Get the current date
current_date = datetime.date(2023, 9, 11)  # Change this to the current date

# Find the last working day
last_working_day = find_last_working_day(current_date)
print("Last working day:", last_working_day)
```

This code defines a function `find_last_working_day` that takes a date and iterates backward until it finds a weekday (Monday to Friday). You can change the `current_date` variable to any date you want, and it will return the last working day for that date.




Certainly! You can use Python to download files using Selenium and check if the downloaded file already exists in a folder. If it doesn't exist, you can proceed with the download. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```python
import os
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service as ChromeService
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# Define the folder where you want to save the downloaded files
download_folder = '/path/to/your/download/folder/'

# Set up Chrome WebDriver with download options
chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_experimental_option('prefs', {
    'download.default_directory': download_folder,
    'download.prompt_for_download': False,
    'download.directory_upgrade': True,
    'safebrowsing.enabled': False,
    'safebrowsing.disable_download_protection': True
})

# Initialize the WebDriver
chromedriver_path = '/path/to/chromedriver'
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chromedriver_path, options=chrome_options)

# Navigate to the webpage where the file download link is
driver.get('https://example.com')

# Locate and click the download link (you'll need to adjust this based on your webpage)
download_link = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="downloadButton"]')
download_link.click()

# Wait for the download to complete (you can adjust the timeout as needed)
wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 60)
wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, '//*[@id="downloadCompleteIndicator"]')))

# List files in the download folder
downloaded_files = os.listdir(download_folder)

# Check if the file you want to download is not already in the folder
file_to_download = 'file_to_download.zip'
if file_to_download not in downloaded_files:
    print(f"Downloading {file_to_download}")
    # Perform the download here

# Close the WebDriver
driver.quit()
```

In this code, replace `'/path/to/your/download/folder/'` with the path to the folder where you want to save the downloaded files, and adjust the URL and element location code to match your specific webpage.

This code first checks if the file you want to download already exists in the specified folder. If it doesn't, it initiates the download. This way, you can avoid downloading duplicate files.
