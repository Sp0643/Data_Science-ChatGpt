HR_ANALYTICE COMPLEX LOGIC


Certainly! Here's a Python code snippet using pandas to implement the described logic:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df is your DataFrame
# Sample DataFrame with 7 columns
data = {
    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'B': [5, 6, 7, 8],
    'C': [9, 10, 11, 12],
    'D': [13, 14, 15, 16],
    'E': [17, 18, 19, 20],
    'F': [21, 22, 23, 24],
    'attribute_side': [25, 26, 27, 28]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Function to generate consecutive numbers starting from 2
def generate_consecutive_numbers(n):
    return list(range(2, n + 2))

# Iterate for 3 years starting from September 2023
for year in range(2023, 2026):
    for month in range(1, 13):
        # Generate consecutive numbers starting from 2
        consecutive_numbers = generate_consecutive_numbers(len(df))

        # Create a new column "attr_month_year"
        df[f'attr_month_year_{month}_{year}'] = df['attribute_side'] * consecutive_numbers

        # Implement logic for subtraction
        condition = (df['A'] == df['B']) & (df['B'] == df['C']) & (df['C'] == df['D'])
        subtracted_values = df.loc[condition, 'B'] - df.loc[condition, f'attr_month_year_{month}_{year}']

        # Capture lines where subtraction occurs
        subtracted_values_index = subtracted_values.index
        df.loc[subtracted_values_index, 'subtract_result'] = subtracted_values

# Display the resulting DataFrame
print(df)
```

This code iterates through each month and year, creating a new column "attr_month_year" and applying the specified logic for subtraction. The result is captured in the "subtract_result" column. Adjust the logic as needed based on your actual DataFrame structure and requirements.






To update the code for pandas version 0.23.4, we need to consider the methods and functions available in that version. Here is the updated code:

1. `json_normalize` should be imported from `pandas.io.json` as it's not directly part of pandas.
2. `explode` method does not exist in pandas 0.23.4, so we need to use an alternative method to achieve the same functionality.

Below is the modified code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.io.json import json_normalize
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Assuming COLLECTION_CASE is a MongoDB collection
# df_case = pd.DataFrame(list(COLLECTION_CASE.find(filter_criteria, projection)))
# For illustration, let's assume df_case is already defined.

# Normalize the JSON data
df_normalized = json_normalize(df_case.to_dict('records'))

# Explode 'serviceRequests' column
df_normalized = df_normalized.set_index(df_normalized.columns.drop('serviceRequests', 1).tolist())
df_normalized = df_normalized['serviceRequests'].apply(pd.Series).stack().reset_index().rename(columns={0:'serviceRequests'})

# Merge back with the rest of the DataFrame
df_normalized = df_normalized.join(df_case, on='level_0').drop(['level_0', 'serviceRequests_y'], axis=1).rename(columns={'serviceRequests_x': 'serviceRequests'})

# Further normalization if needed
df_normalized_final = json_normalize(df_normalized.to_dict('records'))

# Display the result
df_normalized_final.head()
```

Key changes and explanations:
1. Importing `json_normalize` from `pandas.io.json`.
2. Since `explode` is not available, we manually "explode" the `serviceRequests` column by setting the other columns as the index, applying `pd.Series` to `serviceRequests`, using `stack()`, and then resetting the index.
3. Joining the exploded DataFrame back with the original DataFrame to retain all other columns.

Make sure that `df_case` is defined with the relevant data, as this example assumes it is already created from a MongoDB query.



To achieve a feature where users can toggle randomization on and off in your PowerApps quiz-taking app, you can use a toggle control or a radio button control. Below, I'll demonstrate using both a toggle and a radio button for this functionality.

### Using a Toggle Control

1. **Add a Toggle Control:**
   - Insert a Toggle control to your app (let's call it `RandomToggle`).
   - Set the **Text** property of the toggle to "Randomization".

2. **Implement Randomization Logic:**
   - Use the value of the `RandomToggle` to determine whether to randomize the questions.

   Assume you have a collection of questions called `QuestionsCollection`. Here’s an example of how you can randomize based on the toggle value.

   ```plaintext
   If(
       RandomToggle.Value,
       Shuffle(QuestionsCollection), // Randomize if toggle is on
       QuestionsCollection // Use original order if toggle is off
   )
   ```

3. **Display Questions:**
   - Bind the questions to a gallery or any control that displays the questions. For instance, if using a Gallery control named `QuestionsGallery`, set its `Items` property to the above logic.

   ```plaintext
   QuestionsGallery.Items = If(
       RandomToggle.Value,
       Shuffle(QuestionsCollection),
       QuestionsCollection
   )
   ```

### Using a Radio Button Control

1. **Add a Radio Button Control:**
   - Insert a Radio button control to your app (let's call it `RandomOption`).
   - Set the `Items` property of the radio button to `["Randomization On", "Randomization Off"]`.

2. **Implement Randomization Logic:**
   - Use the selected value of the `RandomOption` to determine whether to randomize the questions.

   ```plaintext
   If(
       RandomOption.Selected.Value = "Randomization On",
       Shuffle(QuestionsCollection), // Randomize if selected
       QuestionsCollection // Use original order if not selected
   )
   ```

3. **Display Questions:**
   - Bind the questions to a gallery or any control that displays the questions. For instance, if using a Gallery control named `QuestionsGallery`, set its `Items` property to the above logic.

   ```plaintext
   QuestionsGallery.Items = If(
       RandomOption.Selected.Value = "Randomization On",
       Shuffle(QuestionsCollection),
       QuestionsCollection
   )
   ```

### Complete Example

Here is a complete example using the Toggle control:

1. **Create a Collection:**
   - Create your questions collection. For example:

     ```plaintext
     ClearCollect(QuestionsCollection,
         {Question: "What is 2+2?", Answer: "4"},
         {Question: "What is the capital of France?", Answer: "Paris"},
         {Question: "What is the boiling point of water?", Answer: "100°C"}
     );
     ```

2. **Add a Toggle Control:**
   - Insert a Toggle control and set its `Text` property to "Randomization".

3. **Add a Gallery Control:**
   - Insert a Gallery control to display the questions.
   - Set its `Items` property to:

     ```plaintext
     If(
         RandomToggle.Value,
         Shuffle(QuestionsCollection),
         QuestionsCollection
     )
     ```

4. **Test the App:**
   - Run the app, toggle the `RandomToggle`, and see the questions being randomized or displayed in their original order based on the toggle state.

This approach ensures that your users have control over whether the questions in the quiz are randomized or not, giving them a flexible and interactive experience.
