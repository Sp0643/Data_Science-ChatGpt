To create a customized set of questions from a question bank and store this question subset/collection in another SharePoint list, you can follow these steps:

1. **Correct the Formula**: Ensure that the PowerApps formula is syntactically correct.
2. **Store the Collection in SharePoint List**: Use `Patch` to add the collection to your SharePoint list.

Here's a revised and complete version of your formula:

```plaintext
ClearCollect(
    AllQuestions,
    FirstN(
        Shuffle(
            Filter(
                QuestionBankCollateral, 
                Process = drpQuestionBank.Selected.Value, 
                QuestionType = "MCQ"
            )
        ),
        Int(txtMCQnumber.Text)
    ),
    FirstN(
        Shuffle(
            Filter(
                QuestionBankCollateral, 
                Process = drpQuestionBank.Selected.Value, 
                QuestionType = "Text"
            )
        ),
        Int(txtTextNumber.Text)
    ),
    FirstN(
        Shuffle(
            Filter(
                QuestionBankCollateral, 
                Process = drpQuestionBank.Selected.Value, 
                QuestionType = "TF"
            )
        ),
        Int(txtTFnumber.Text)
    )
);
```

To store this collection in a SharePoint list, you will need to use the `ForAll` and `Patch` functions. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Add a Button**: Add a button to your PowerApps screen.
2. **Set Button's `OnSelect` Property**: Set the button's `OnSelect` property to use `ForAll` and `Patch`.

```plaintext
ForAll(
    AllQuestions,
    Patch(
        YourSharePointList,
        Defaults(YourSharePointList),
        {
            Title: Title, // Assuming "Title" is a column in your SharePoint list
            Question: Question, // Assuming "Question" is a column in your SharePoint list
            QuestionType: QuestionType,
            Process: Process
            // Add other columns as necessary
        }
    )
)
```

Replace `YourSharePointList` with the name of your SharePoint list, and make sure to map the fields correctly.

### Steps Breakdown:

1. **Generate the Customized Set of Questions**:
   - Use the `ClearCollect` formula to create a collection named `AllQuestions` with your filtered and shuffled questions.

2. **Store the Collection in SharePoint List**:
   - Use the `ForAll` function to iterate through each item in the `AllQuestions` collection.
   - Use the `Patch` function to add each item to the SharePoint list.

### Example with Button:

1. Add a button to the screen and set its `OnSelect` property:

```plaintext
OnSelect:
ClearCollect(
    AllQuestions,
    FirstN(
        Shuffle(
            Filter(
                QuestionBankCollateral, 
                Process = drpQuestionBank.Selected.Value, 
                QuestionType = "MCQ"
            )
        ),
        Int(txtMCQnumber.Text)
    ),
    FirstN(
        Shuffle(
            Filter(
                QuestionBankCollateral, 
                Process = drpQuestionBank.Selected.Value, 
                QuestionType = "Text"
            )
        ),
        Int(txtTextNumber.Text)
    ),
    FirstN(
        Shuffle(
            Filter(
                QuestionBankCollateral, 
                Process = drpQuestionBank.Selected.Value, 
                QuestionType = "TF"
            )
        ),
        Int(txtTFnumber.Text)
    )
);

ForAll(
    AllQuestions,
    Patch(
        YourSharePointList,
        Defaults(YourSharePointList),
        {
            Title: Title, 
            Question: Question, 
            QuestionType: QuestionType,
            Process: Process
        }
    )
)
```

This should help you filter, shuffle, collect, and store your question subset in another SharePoint list.
