To create a customized set of questions from a question bank and store this question subset/collection in another SharePoint list, you can follow these steps:

1. **Correct the Formula**: Ensure that the PowerApps formula is syntactically correct.
2. **Store the Collection in SharePoint List**: Use `Patch` to add the collection to your SharePoint list.

Here's a revised and complete version of your formula:

```plaintext
ClearCollect(
    AllQuestions,
    FirstN(
        Shuffle(
            Filter(
                QuestionBankCollateral, 
                Process = drpQuestionBank.Selected.Value, 
                QuestionType = "MCQ"
            )
        ),
        Int(txtMCQnumber.Text)
    ),
    FirstN(
        Shuffle(
            Filter(
                QuestionBankCollateral, 
                Process = drpQuestionBank.Selected.Value, 
                QuestionType = "Text"
            )
        ),
        Int(txtTextNumber.Text)
    ),
    FirstN(
        Shuffle(
            Filter(
                QuestionBankCollateral, 
                Process = drpQuestionBank.Selected.Value, 
                QuestionType = "TF"
            )
        ),
        Int(txtTFnumber.Text)
    )
);
```

To store this collection in a SharePoint list, you will need to use the `ForAll` and `Patch` functions. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Add a Button**: Add a button to your PowerApps screen.
2. **Set Button's `OnSelect` Property**: Set the button's `OnSelect` property to use `ForAll` and `Patch`.

```plaintext
ForAll(
    AllQuestions,
    Patch(
        YourSharePointList,
        Defaults(YourSharePointList),
        {
            Title: Title, // Assuming "Title" is a column in your SharePoint list
            Question: Question, // Assuming "Question" is a column in your SharePoint list
            QuestionType: QuestionType,
            Process: Process
            // Add other columns as necessary
        }
    )
)
```

Replace `YourSharePointList` with the name of your SharePoint list, and make sure to map the fields correctly.

### Steps Breakdown:

1. **Generate the Customized Set of Questions**:
   - Use the `ClearCollect` formula to create a collection named `AllQuestions` with your filtered and shuffled questions.

2. **Store the Collection in SharePoint List**:
   - Use the `ForAll` function to iterate through each item in the `AllQuestions` collection.
   - Use the `Patch` function to add each item to the SharePoint list.

### Example with Button:

1. Add a button to the screen and set its `OnSelect` property:

```plaintext
OnSelect:
ClearCollect(
    AllQuestions,
    FirstN(
        Shuffle(
            Filter(
                QuestionBankCollateral, 
                Process = drpQuestionBank.Selected.Value, 
                QuestionType = "MCQ"
            )
        ),
        Int(txtMCQnumber.Text)
    ),
    FirstN(
        Shuffle(
            Filter(
                QuestionBankCollateral, 
                Process = drpQuestionBank.Selected.Value, 
                QuestionType = "Text"
            )
        ),
        Int(txtTextNumber.Text)
    ),
    FirstN(
        Shuffle(
            Filter(
                QuestionBankCollateral, 
                Process = drpQuestionBank.Selected.Value, 
                QuestionType = "TF"
            )
        ),
        Int(txtTFnumber.Text)
    )
);

ForAll(
    AllQuestions,
    Patch(
        YourSharePointList,
        Defaults(YourSharePointList),
        {
            Title: Title, 
            Question: Question, 
            QuestionType: QuestionType,
            Process: Process
        }
    )
)
```

This should help you filter, shuffle, collect, and store your question subset in another SharePoint list.



To generate a unique alphanumeric quiz ID in Power Apps with the format `YYMonthN` (where `YY` is the last two digits of the current year, `Month` is the full month name, and `N` is an incrementing number), you can use Power FX code. 

Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

1. **Retrieve the current year and month.**
2. **Fetch the last generated ID from your data source.**
3. **Increment the number part of the last ID.**

Assuming you're using a SharePoint list named "QuizIDs" with a column "QuizID" to store these IDs, the Power FX code will look something like this:

```PowerFX
// Define the current year and month
Set(CurrentYear, Text(Today(), "yy"));
Set(CurrentMonth, Text(Today(), "mmmm"));

// Fetch the last generated ID from the SharePoint list
Set(LastGeneratedID, Last(Sort(Filter(QuizIDs, StartsWith(QuizID, CurrentYear & CurrentMonth)), QuizID, Descending)).QuizID);

// Extract the numeric part of the last generated ID
Set(LastNumber, If(IsBlank(LastGeneratedID), 0, Value(Mid(LastGeneratedID, Len(CurrentYear & CurrentMonth) + 1, Len(LastGeneratedID) - Len(CurrentYear & CurrentMonth)))));

// Increment the number
Set(NewNumber, LastNumber + 1);

// Construct the new QuizID
Set(NewQuizID, CurrentYear & CurrentMonth & Text(NewNumber));

// Display or save the new QuizID
NewQuizID
```

### Explanation:

1. **Set(CurrentYear, Text(Today(), "yy"))**: Retrieves the last two digits of the current year.
2. **Set(CurrentMonth, Text(Today(), "mmmm"))**: Retrieves the full name of the current month.
3. **Set(LastGeneratedID, Last(...))**: Fetches the last generated QuizID from the SharePoint list, sorted in descending order, to get the most recent one.
4. **Set(LastNumber, ...)**: Extracts the numeric part of the last generated ID. If there is no last ID, it sets `LastNumber` to 0.
5. **Set(NewNumber, LastNumber + 1)**: Increments the numeric part by 1.
6. **Set(NewQuizID, CurrentYear & CurrentMonth & Text(NewNumber))**: Constructs the new QuizID by concatenating the year, month, and the new number.
7. **NewQuizID**: Displays or uses the new QuizID.

### Notes:
- Ensure your SharePoint list "QuizIDs" exists and has a column "QuizID" to store these IDs.
- This code should be placed in the relevant location in your Power Apps app, such as in the `OnSelect` property of a button that generates new quiz IDs.
- Make sure to handle any potential race conditions if multiple users might generate IDs simultaneously.



To meet the specified requirements, the Power FX code can be structured as follows:

```PowerFX
// Define the current year and month
Set(CurrentYear, Text(Today(), "yy"));
Set(CurrentMonth, Text(Today(), "mmmm"));

// Fetch the last generated ID from the SharePoint list
Set(LastGeneratedID, Last(Sort(Filter(QuizIDs, StartsWith(QuizID, "Quiz" & CurrentYear & CurrentMonth)), QuizID, Descending)).QuizID);

// Extract the numeric part of the last generated ID
Set(LastNumber, If(IsBlank(LastGeneratedID), 0, Value(Mid(LastGeneratedID, Len("Quiz" & CurrentYear & CurrentMonth) + 1, Len(LastGeneratedID) - Len("Quiz" & CurrentYear & CurrentMonth)))));

// Increment the number
Set(NewNumber, LastNumber + 1);

// Construct the new QuizID
Set(NewQuizID, "Quiz" & CurrentYear & CurrentMonth & Text(NewNumber));

// Display or save the new QuizID
NewQuizID
```

### Explanation:

1. **Set(CurrentYear, Text(Today(), "yy"))**: Retrieves the last two digits of the current year.
2. **Set(CurrentMonth, Text(Today(), "mmmm"))**: Retrieves the full name of the current month.
3. **Set(LastGeneratedID, Last(...))**: Fetches the last generated QuizID from the SharePoint list, filtered to the current year and month, and sorted in descending order to get the most recent one.
4. **Set(LastNumber, ...)**: Extracts the numeric part of the last generated ID. If there is no last ID, it sets `LastNumber` to 0.
5. **Set(NewNumber, LastNumber + 1)**: Increments the numeric part by 1.
6. **Set(NewQuizID, "Quiz" & CurrentYear & CurrentMonth & Text(NewNumber))**: Constructs the new QuizID by concatenating "Quiz", the year, the month, and the new number.
7. **NewQuizID**: Displays or uses the new QuizID.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure your SharePoint list "QuizIDs" exists and has a column "QuizID" to store these IDs.
- This code should be placed in the relevant location in your Power Apps app, such as in the `OnSelect` property of a button that generates new quiz IDs.
- Make sure to handle any potential race conditions if multiple users might generate IDs simultaneously.

ClearCollect(
    LastQuizID,
    SortByColumns(QuizConfiguration, "CreatedOn", Descending)
)

ClearCollect(
    QuizIDParts,
    {
        Prefix: "Quiz",
        Year: Right(Text(Today(), "YYYY"), 2),
        Month: Lower(Text(Today(), "MMM")),
        Number: If(
            CountRows(
                Filter(LastQuizID,
                    Left(QuizID, 7) = Concatenate("Quiz", Right(Text(Today(), "YYYY"), 2), Lower(Text(Today(), "MMM")))
                )
            ) > 0,
            Value(Right(Last(LastQuizID).QuizID, 2)) + 1,
            1
        )
    }
)

// Generate the QuizID
Concatenate(
    First(QuizIDParts).Prefix,
    First(QuizIDParts).Year,
    First(QuizIDParts).Month,
    Text(First(QuizIDParts).Number, "00")
)



To store these generated IDs in a SharePoint list or any data source within Power Apps, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create Columns in SharePoint List**: Ensure you have columns named `QuizID` and `NotificationID` in your SharePoint list.

2. **Generate and Store IDs**: Use Power Fx formulas to generate the IDs and then save them to the SharePoint list.

Here's an example on how to set and store the information in a SharePoint list:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Generate Unique IDs**:
   Use variables to generate and store the IDs when a new item is created.

2. **Patch to SharePoint List**:
   Use the `Patch` function to save the new item with the generated IDs to your SharePoint list.

### Example Code in Power Fx

#### OnSelect Property of a Button to Create a New Quiz
```plaintext
// Generate unique QuizID
Set(varQuizID, "QUIZ-" & Text(Now(), "yyyyMMdd-HHmmss") & "-" & Text(Rand() * 10000, "0000"));

// Patch the new quiz item to SharePoint list
Patch(
    YourSharePointListName,
    Defaults(YourSharePointListName),
    {
        QuizID: varQuizID,
        Title: "Your Quiz Title", // Replace with your actual title or other fields
        // Add other fields as needed
    }
);
```

#### OnSelect Property of a Button to Create a New Notification
```plaintext
// Generate unique NotificationID
Set(varNotificationID, "NOTIF-" & Text(Now(), "yyyyMMdd-HHmmss") & "-" & Text(Rand() * 10000, "0000"));

// Patch the new notification item to SharePoint list
Patch(
    YourNotificationSharePointListName,
    Defaults(YourNotificationSharePointListName),
    {
        NotificationID: varNotificationID,
        Title: "Your Notification Title", // Replace with your actual title or other fields
        // Add other fields as needed
    }
);
```

### Explanation
- `Set(varQuizID, ...)` and `Set(varNotificationID, ...)`: These lines generate and store the unique IDs in variables.
- `Patch(YourSharePointListName, Defaults(YourSharePointListName), { ... })`: This line saves a new item to the specified SharePoint list using the generated IDs and any additional fields you want to include.

Replace `YourSharePointListName` and `YourNotificationSharePointListName` with the actual names of your SharePoint lists. Adjust the fields inside the `Patch` function as necessary to match the structure of your SharePoint lists.



To patch a new question to your SharePoint data source and ensure the new question ID is incremented by 1 from the last question ID, you can follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve the Last Question ID:**
   Use the `Last` function to get the highest question ID from your SharePoint list.
   
2. **Increment the Question ID:**
   Add 1 to the last question ID to create a new unique question ID.
   
3. **Patch the New Question:**
   Use the `Patch` function to add the new question to your SharePoint data source.

### Implementation

1. **Retrieve the Last Question ID:**
   ```PowerApps
   // Assuming your SharePoint list is named QuestionsDataSource and QuestionID is the column for question IDs
   LastQuestionID = Last(Sort(QuestionsDataSource, QuestionID, Descending)).QuestionID
   ```

2. **Increment the Question ID:**
   ```PowerApps
   NewQuestionID = LastQuestionID + 1
   ```

3. **Patch the New Question:**
   Assuming you have a form to collect new question details, and you have text inputs or dropdowns to gather the new question details.

   ```PowerApps
   Patch(QuestionsDataSource, Defaults(QuestionsDataSource), 
         {
           QuestionID: NewQuestionID,
           Theme: DropdownTheme.Selected.Value,
           QuestionType: DropdownQuestionType.Selected.Value,
           QuestionText: TextInputQuestionText.Text,
           Answer: TextInputAnswer.Text
         });
   ```

### Complete Code for Button OnSelect

Hereâ€™s the complete code for the `OnSelect` property of a button that will add a new question:

```PowerApps
// Step 1: Get the last question ID
Set(LastQuestionID, Last(Sort(QuestionsDataSource, QuestionID, Descending)).QuestionID);

// Step 2: Increment the question ID
Set(NewQuestionID, LastQuestionID + 1);

// Step 3: Patch the new question
Patch(QuestionsDataSource, Defaults(QuestionsDataSource), 
      {
        QuestionID: NewQuestionID,
        Theme: DropdownTheme.Selected.Value,
        QuestionType: DropdownQuestionType.Selected.Value,
        QuestionText: TextInputQuestionText.Text,
        Answer: TextInputAnswer.Text
      });

// Optionally refresh the data source to reflect the new question in the gallery
Refresh(QuestionsDataSource);
```

### Explanation

- **Set Variables:** Use `Set` to create variables for the last question ID and the new question ID.
- **Sort and Last:** Use `Sort` and `Last` to get the highest question ID in descending order.
- **Patch:** Use `Patch` to add the new question to the SharePoint list, setting the `QuestionID` to `NewQuestionID` and other fields to the values from the form inputs.
- **Refresh:** Optionally, refresh the data source to update the gallery with the new question.

By implementing this code in the `OnSelect` property of a button, you can ensure that new questions are added with unique, incremented question IDs and that the new question data is correctly patched to your SharePoint data source.
