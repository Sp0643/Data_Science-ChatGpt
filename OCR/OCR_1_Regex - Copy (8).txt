Certainly! To display the countdown in the format "minutes:seconds" in Power Apps, you can modify the Label's Text property as follows:

```plaintext
Text(RoundDown((Timer1.Duration - Timer1.Value) / 1000 / 60, 0), "[$-en]General Number") & ":" & Text(Mod(RoundDown((Timer1.Duration - Timer1.Value) / 1000, 0), 60), "[$-en]General Number")
```

This formula calculates the remaining minutes and seconds separately and concatenates them in the format "minutes:seconds". Adjust the control names based on your actual setup (e.g., replace "Timer1" with your Timer control's name).


I apologize for the confusion. Let's correct the formula for displaying the countdown in "minutes:seconds." Use the following formula for the Label's Text property:

```plaintext
Text(RoundDown(Timer1.Value / 60000, 0), "[$-en]General Number") & ":" & Text(RoundDown(Mod(Timer1.Value, 60000) / 1000, 0), "[$-en]General Number")
```

This formula calculates the remaining minutes and seconds separately and concatenates them in the format "minutes:seconds". Replace "Timer1" with the actual name of your Timer control.


Certainly! To achieve this, you'll want to filter the data based on the entered kid and display the corresponding username. Here's a basic example assuming you have a TextBox for the user to enter the kid's name and a Label to display the welcome message:

1. **Insert TextBox for Kid's name:**
   - Insert a TextBox control for the user to input the kid's name.

2. **Insert Label for Welcome message:**
   - Insert a Label control where you want to display the welcome message.

3. **Set Label's Text property:**
   - Set the `Text` property of the Label to the following formula (replace "YourDataSource" with your actual data source and "KidColumnName" and "UsernameColumnName" with the actual column names):
   ```plaintext
   "Welcome " & LookUp(YourDataSource, KidColumnName = TextInput1.Text, UsernameColumnName)
   ```
   This formula uses the `LookUp` function to find the username where the kid's name matches the input from the TextBox.

4. **Handle non-matching case:**
   - To handle the case where the kid's name doesn't match any entry, you can modify the formula to provide a default message:
   ```plaintext
   If(IsBlank(LookUp(YourDataSource, KidColumnName = TextInput1.Text, UsernameColumnName)), "Kid not found", "Welcome " & LookUp(YourDataSource, KidColumnName = TextInput1.Text, UsernameColumnName))
   ```

Remember to replace "YourDataSource," "KidColumnName," and "UsernameColumnName" with your actual data source and column names. Adjust this example based on your specific data structure and app design.



Certainly, if the correct answers are coming from an Excel file, you'll need to fetch those correct answers dynamically. Assuming you have a table named `Questions` in your Excel file with columns `Question`, `CorrectAnswer`, and `UserAnswer` in Power Apps, you can modify the formulas like this:

**MCQ (Multiple Choice Questions) Score Formula:**
```plaintext
If(
    ThisItem.UserAnswer = LookUp(Questions, Question = ThisItem.Question).CorrectAnswer,
    PointsForCorrectAnswer,
    PointsForIncorrectAnswer
)
```

**Boolean Score Formula:**
```plaintext
If(
    ThisItem.UserAnswer = LookUp(Questions, Question = ThisItem.Question).CorrectAnswer,
    PointsForCorrectAnswer,
    PointsForIncorrectAnswer
)
```

Here, `LookUp(Questions, Question = ThisItem.Question).CorrectAnswer` fetches the correct answer from the Excel table based on the current question.

Make sure to replace `Questions` with the actual name of your Excel table, and adjust field names as needed. Also, set appropriate values for `PointsForCorrectAnswer` and `PointsForIncorrectAnswer`.



To store the score data in a user response Excel sheet, you'll need to add a step to update or create records in your Excel file based on the user's responses. Here's a simplified example:

Assuming you have a table named `UserResponses` in your Excel file with columns `UserName`, `Question`, `UserAnswer`, and `Score`, you can use the following formula after calculating the score:

```plaintext
Patch(
    UserResponses,
    Defaults(UserResponses),
    {
        UserName: User().FullName,  // Assuming you want to store the user's name
        Question: ThisItem.Question,
        UserAnswer: ThisItem.UserAnswer,
        Score: If(
            ThisItem.UserAnswer = LookUp(Questions, Question = ThisItem.Question).CorrectAnswer,
            PointsForCorrectAnswer,
            PointsForIncorrectAnswer
        )
    }
)
```

This `Patch` function creates a new record in the `UserResponses` table, or updates an existing record if a record with the same `UserName` and `Question` already exists. Replace `UserResponses` with the actual name of your Excel table, and adjust field names as needed.

Make sure to include this formula in the appropriate place in your app where you are processing the user's responses..


Sure, it sounds like you have a comprehensive plan for creating a dashboard in your PowerApp to track user performance in the quiz. Here's a step-by-step guide along with relevant formulas for each component of your dashboard:

**1. Attempt Rate:**
   - To calculate the attempt rate, count the number of users who have submitted the test compared to the total number of users.

   ```plaintext
   CountRows(SubmittedUsers) / CountRows(AllUsers)
   ```

**2. Total Score for Each User:**
   - Assuming you have a column named `Score` in your response Excel sheet and `KID` is the unique identifier:

   ```plaintext
   Sum(Filter(QuizResponses, KID = "K058224"), Score)
   ```

**3. Pass Percentage:**
   - Assuming you have a pass percentage of 80%, count the number of users who scored above this percentage.

   ```plaintext
   CountRows(Filter(SubmittedUsers, TotalScore >= (TotalQuestions * PassPercentage)))
   ```

**4. Comparison to Others:**
   - You can use the `Rank` function to rank users based on their scores and then compare their rank with others.

   ```plaintext
   Rank(CurrentUser.Score, AllUsers.Score)
   ```

**5. Team-Wise Average Score:**
   - Assuming you have a column named `Team` in your user data, you can calculate the average score for each team.

   ```plaintext
   ClearCollect(
      TeamScores,
      AddColumns(
         GroupBy(SubmittedUsers, "Team", "TeamSummary"),
         "AverageScore",
         Average(TeamSummary.Score)
      )
   )
   ```

**6. Team-Wise Pass Percentage:**
   - Similar to the pass percentage calculation, count the number of users in each team who passed.

   ```plaintext
   CountRows(
      Filter(
         TeamScores,
         AverageScore >= (TotalQuestions * PassPercentage)
      )
   )
   ```

These formulas are simplified examples, and you might need to adapt them based on your actual data structure and requirements. Ensure that you replace table and column names with your real data sources, and adjust any constants like `PassPercentage` based on your specific scenario. If you encounter any specific challenges while implementing these, feel free to ask for more guidance!
