To clarify, we create an Excel report using a Python script and send it to users via email. Currently, we've set up a batch file using the Windows Task Scheduler. To enhance security, we're considering deploying the report in a more secure environment. Given that deployment is beyond our team's scope, my manager suggests the implementation of a cron job and utilizing a production-ready scheduler based on our discussion.

2. Clarification: We generate an Excel report through a Python script and distribute it to users via email. The current setup involves a batch file and the Windows Task Scheduler. To boost security, we're exploring the possibility of deploying the report in a more secure environment. As deployment is not within our team's purview, my manager recommends setting up a cron job and utilizing a production-ready scheduler following our discussion.

3. In summary, our process involves creating an Excel report with a Python script and delivering it to users via email. Currently, we've employed a batch file through the Windows Task Scheduler. Considering the need for heightened security, we are exploring the deployment of the report in a more secure environment. Since deployment is beyond our team's responsibility, my manager suggests establishing a cron job and utilizing a production-ready scheduler based on our discussion.

In the context of the GSS 1.0 initiative, we have successfully implemented multiple dashboard solutions for the Loan Maintenance organization.

With the introduction of GSS 2.0, we are currently in the process of onboarding new organizations, with a focus on specialized services and commercial real estate.

In my capacity, I am tasked with developing fundamental Tableau dashboard functionalities and providing support to Sangeeth and Sandeep to ensure the timely delivery of these dashboards.

Additionally, under the GSS 2.0 framework, we are responsible for generating MM EOD reports for all organizations involved in outbound money movement activities. Furthermore, we are addressing three ad hoc requests until the necessary data is available in the SMART DB.

In my role, I am responsible for creating these reports by accessing the GSS MongoDB database and utilizing Python in conjunction with Windows Task Scheduler. Moreover, I am collaborating with the Technology team to obtain Autosys access and to enhance the security of service credentials for the GSS MongoDB Production database.

"In addition to the aforementioned initiative, we are currently focused on delivering an analytics-powered dashboard within GSS. Our team has developed a proof of concept (POC) solution for text analytics. My responsibility entails leveraging Python to craft a text analytics solution aimed at extracting insights from comment data."



This initiative entails comprehending AWB and GitHub, facilitating team onboarding, and conducting team training sessions.


The Process Knowledge Tool (PKT) project aims to transform a traditionally manual process into an automated solution using Power Apps. The current system involves numerous employees managing tasks such as creating questionnaires, distributing them, collecting responses, performing manual evaluations, and delivering scorecards. This manual approach is time-consuming and prone to errors.

The PKT project seeks to streamline and automate these processes, improving control, efficiency, and risk mitigation. By leveraging Power Apps, the new solution will replicate these tasks in a more organized and efficient manner, reducing the reliance on manual efforts and enhancing overall process management.

The project involves collaboration among three teams, led by Sudhir, Kiran, and Anand. Coordination and information gathering are done with the help of Swarnika, with the goal of deploying the automated solution into production as soon as possible.


My responsibilities involve collaborating with three teams led by Sudhir, Kiran, and Anand to gather user requirements and develop solutions. We have successfully developed a complete solution for Sudhir's team. Currently, Varnika and I are working together on developing solutions for Kiran's and Anand's teams.



Looking forward, I aim to utilize my expertise in Python and analytics to undertake more projects in areas such as natural language processing (NLP) and forecasting.
